Deep-Learning Tensorflow Urban Sound Classification - Sandeep Kanao


Problem Statement When you start your machine learning journey, you go with simple machine learning problems like titanic survival prediction or digit recogntion. But you still don't have enough practice when it comes to real life problems. To give you a taste of one such problem, we present you "Urban Sound Classification". This practice problem is meant to introduce you to audio processing in the usual classification scenario.

Data This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music.
